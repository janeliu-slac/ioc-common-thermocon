# ioc-common-thermocon
This is an EPICS IOC that is used at LCLS. This repo was automatically transferred to github from an internal filesystem repository via the scripts at https://github.com/pcdshub/afs_ioc_migration.

The original filesystem location was /afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/cd/swe/git/repos/package/epics/ioc/common/thermocon.git.
